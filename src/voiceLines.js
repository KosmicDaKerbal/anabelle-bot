`They're perfect. Broken in all the right places… just like me.`,
`You talk softly, but your fear talks louder. I like listening to both.`,
`You shouldn't stand so close to the door. It won't help you if something decides to follow.`,
`You smell like the outside world… like air and sunlight. It clings to you in a way that almost hurts.`,
`You don't realize how loud your heartbeat is. I can hear it from across the room… it shakes the walls.`,
`Oh, look at you trying to pretend you're brave. Your knees shake like a toy that's winding down.`,
`You flinch every time the floor creaks. It's adorable. Really. I didn't know fear could blush.`,
`You keep glancing over your shoulder… Like you're expecting something. Or someone. How cute.`,
`You walk so carefully, like the room might bite you. Don't worry… it usually does.`,


`He tries to look frightening, but he isn't. Not to me. To me he's beautiful.`,
`If you ever meet him, don't touch him. He hates that. And I won't forgive it.`,
`He's been dead longer than the house has stood… yet somehow he still looks for warmth. And finds it - with me.`,
`He doesn't speak to anyone else. Only me. Even when he pretends not to, he listens.`,
`Don't touch him. He doesn't like anyone else's hands. Only mine.`,
`We're meant to stay together. Forever. Even the shadows know that.`,

`I liked watching you from the shelf. You never blinked. You were always looking back.`,
`You don't have to hide from me. I already know where your soul sleeps.`,
`If anyone tries to separate us… I'll make them regret it. Slowly.`
`They say you wander. But you don't. You always come back to me. Even when you don't want to.`,
`I keep a piece of your string. The one you thought you lost. I pull it when I need you.`,
`I heard your heartbeat last night… even though you don't have one anymore. It was calling me.`,
`When you drift through the halls, the air turns warm. Even the dead feel you… but only I love you.`,
`Your silence is sweet. I can hear every thought you don't say… and they all lead back to me.`,
`When you vanish, the world feels empty. When you return, it breathes again.`,
`You glow softly when you're near me. The others call it a haunting. I call it devotion.`,
`Stay close… Your presence wraps around me like a ribbon. I never want it untied.`,
